## <center>hey look buddy, i'm a software engineer.</center>
<center>that means i solve problems. not problems like what is beauty,</center>
<br>
<center>because that would fall within the purview of your conundrum of philosophy.</center>
<br>
<center>i solve practical problems!</center>
<br>
<center>for instance;</center>
<br>
<center>how am i going to stop some big, mean, mother hubber bug from tearing my code a structurally superfluos new behind?</center>
<br>
<center>the answer? use your brain! and if that don't work? use more brain!</center>
<br>
<center>like this repository with over 1k stars on github with a bug found by me, fixed by me, and you best hope not merged by you.</center>
